# Smart Grid CPS Security

The purpose of this coursework is to understand the linear programming based energy scheduling for smart home cyber-physical system, interdependence between the pricing information and the energy load scheduling. It also includes developing detection techniques for pricing attacks, while getting familiar with some cyber-physical system security programming skills. This section describes the information about Linear programming and the algorithms, libraries like sklearn, matplotlib, pulp, etc in Python.
